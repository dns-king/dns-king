One unique aspect of my journey to becoming a self-taught software engineer is that I didn't initially plan to pursue a career in technology. I thought I'd be a soccer star.
However, I've always had a natural curiosity and passion for technology, and I started teaching myself programming as a hobby.
I quickly became hooked and spent most of my free time reading books and watching online tutorials.
Eventually, I realized that I was much more passionate about programming than I originally thought and decided to make a career change, took a huge leap of faith but I'm glad I'm still doing work that I love.

As a self-taught software engineer, I enjoy both frontend and backend development. But, if I had to choose, I would say that I love backend development the most. I appreciate the fact that back-end development is less visually oriented than frontend development. While frontend development requires a strong sense of design and aesthetics, and as we all know backend development is more focused on functionality and performance. This has allowed me to really dive deep into the code and solve problems without getting distracted by visual design elements. So yeah, I just prefer backend stuff, despite the challenges that come with it I feel it's highly rewarding!

### :man_technologist: Let me introduce myself :
I am a self-taught software engineer <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"> from South Africa!!

I decided to teach myself how to code for a few reasons. Firstly, I've always been fascinated by technology and computers. The idea of building something from scratch and bringing it to life with just a few lines of code is empowering. Secondly, as a self-taught developer, I've had the flexibility to tailor my learning according to my own pace and interests, I could choose what topics to focus on and dive deeper into areas that captivated me the most. Lastly, through self-teaching I've developed a strong sense of curiosity. The process of figuring things out on my own, troubleshooting errors, and finding solutions has been incredibly frustrating but also incredibly rewarding!... As a self-taught developer, I enjoy both frontend and backend development but if I had to choose I would say I love backend development the most.

One unique aspect of my journey to becoming a self-taught software engineer is that I didn't initially plan to pursue a career in technology. I thought I'd be a soccer star.
However, I've always had a natural curiosity and passion for technology, and I started teaching myself programming as a hobby.
I quickly became hooked and spent most of my free time reading books and watching online tutorials.
Eventually, I realized that I was much more passionate about programming than I originally thought and decided to make a career change, took a huge leap of faith but I'm glad I'm still doing work that I love.

As a self-taught software engineer, I enjoy both frontend and backend development. But, if I had to choose, I would say that I love backend development the most. I appreciate the fact that back-end development is less visually oriented than frontend development. While frontend development requires a strong sense of design and aesthetics, and as we all know backend development is more focused on functionality and performance. This has allowed me to really dive deep into the code and solve problems without getting distracted by visual design elements. So yeah, I just prefer backend stuff, despite the challenges that come with it I feel it's highly rewarding!
